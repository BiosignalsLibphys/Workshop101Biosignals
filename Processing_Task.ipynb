Now, it's time to process the data, i.e. when the signals are collected, you need to analyze and preprocess them to ensure they are clean and suitable for further processing. This involves tasks such as filtering noise, normalizing amplitude values, segmenting the data into meaningful time windows, and extracting relevant features that will be used in subsequent analysis or modeling steps."
