## Biosignals collection tasks

### A. Speediance: EMG collection

Task: perform 10 repetitions of the triceps extension with the rope exercise. Rest 1 min and repeat the task 2 more times.

Sensors placement: place the electrodes on the triceps belly (and the reference on the elbow).



### B. Gait analysis: ACC collection

Task: walk to end of the corridor and back 3 times. Rest 10 s. Do the same running.

Sensors placement: place the electrodes on the lateral malleus of the right ankle.



### C. VR experience: ECG collection

Task: explore the International Space Station for 5 minutes.

Sensors placement: place the electrodes on the chest according to the Einthoven's triangle.


### HAVE A NICE WORKSHOP! :)
